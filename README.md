# ImageCheckboxes
This is a script that enables you to use images as checkboxes within a web form by way of CSS.

Initially this existed as a JS Fiddle here http://jsfiddle.net/coolwebs/qf1qs8kg/ but now moving the scripts into GitHub for the sake of prosperity and sharing.

Simple web form that uses HTML and CSS. Not much to it really, just another more interesting way of presenting a web form with checkbox options.

Included are the demo files. Feel free to change/modify them to suit your project requirements.
